      <p>SEO stands for “Search Engine Optimization”. On-page SEO is what we call the best practises of optimizing your web pages, so that they have the best opportunity to rank high up on Google’s search result page (SERP). Mostly the same tactics can be used to optimize for other search engines as well (such as Bing and Yahoo), but since Google is by far the most popular one, we are primarily focusing on their search engine.<p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section id="Keywords" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Keywords</h3></header>
    <article>
        <p>
          Keywords are what we call the different phrases that people search for in Google, and the phrases that you should focus on on your particular web page to rank for a specific subject.
        </p>
        <h4>Keyword research - Finding the right keyword</h4>
        <p>
          Let’s say you own a camping site in Sweden and you want people to find your website when they are planning their summer holiday. Then, you might want to rank for the keywords: “Best Camping site in Sweden” , “Cheap camping Sweden” or “Sweden’s best camping sites”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing you should do is to find out what phrase has the highest search volume. There are several tools that you can use to do this. I recommend checking out <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a>. You might find that people search for phrases that you had not even thought about.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should also compare the “keyword difficulty” of the different keywords. The higher the score, the harder the competition to rank for that particular keyword. 
      </p>
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>
        So, you have found the keyword that you want to rank for, now what?
      </p>
      <p>
        Your next step is to implement the keyword on the page on your website that you want to use to try and rank for it. It’s important that the subject of the webpage actually is connected to the keyword, and it must show up on the page in a natural way. You might have heard of “keyword stuffing”, that’s when you overuse the keyword and put it in your content way to much, so that it looks unnatural. That is something you should avoid and can potentially do more harm than good. You need to get a good feeling for how many times is just enough to mention the keyword. There is not one perfect answer to this, but it you read the text out loud, it’s often easy to hear if the keyword is mentioned a bit to much.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do something similar to the guide below you should be fine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li-marker">Include the keyword in the meta title</li>
        <li class="li-marker">Include the keyword in the H1</li>
        <li class="li-marker">Include a variation of the keyword in the H2</li>
        <li class="li-marker">Include the keyword 1-2 times per every 300-400 words of content</li>
      </ul>
    </article>      
  </section>
  <section id="Meta_title_&_description" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Meta title & description</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>The meta title and description is basically what is shown to the user when your page is shown in Google’s search result. It’s a blue text snippet which you click to get to the page (the title), with a longer, black text snippet below (the description). In between the title and the description you can see the page’s URL. Google anything to see examples.</p>
      <h4>
        Meta title optimization
      </h4>
      <p>
        The meta title is one of the most important things when it comes to on-page SEO. Google checks your title to know what your page is about, so it is crucial that you include your target keyword in the meta title. You should even try to include it as early as possible in your title, as Google gives more weight to the words in the beginning of if.
      </p>
      <p>
        It it also important that you optimize the length of the title. If it is too long it will not fit in the SERP and will ether be cut or Google might just create a new one from content on your page. There are different guidelines to be read on the internet regarding optimal title length, and what is considered best practice has changed several times. Google recently announced that they are prioritizing mobile search (searches made via mobile devices such as smartphones), since a higher and higher percentage of all searches are done via just that. Therefore it is now best to optimize the title length so it fits the mobile SERP.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also choose between optimizing using max characters or max pixel width. We recommend using pixel width. You can check pixel width with several different tools online, but if you have the possibility to use <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/">Screaming Frog</a>, I suggest that you check out the “SERP Snippet” function. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Meta title maximum pixel width for mobile SERP: <b>475px</b>
      </p>
      <h4>
        Meta description Optimization
      </h4>
      <p>
        Unlike the meta title, Google does not check your meta description when deciding if your page should rank or not. However, the meta description is extremely important when it comes to making users click on your page in the SERP. The goal is to get traffic to your website, if you are ranking but no-one is clicking through to you, then your SEO efforts are worth nothing. And something that Google actually do check is your CTR (click through rate). They will notice if not enough people are clicking on your page, even if you are ranking high up on the SERP. That might result in your site being put further down on the SERP.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you understand, making sure you have a good and targeted meta description is very important. It is your opportunity to “sell” your particular page to the users that just got it in their result. It’s a good idea, for both the title and the description, to check out what competitors have put in theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The length of the description has to be optimized for the same reasons as the meta title.
      </p>
      <p>Meta description maximum pixel width for mobile SERP: <b>755px</b></p>
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>
        To add your optimized meta title and description to your page, you need to add the following in the head element of your HTML code, like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          <xmp>
  <title>Your meta title</title>
  <meta name="description"
  content="Your meta description"/>
          </xmp>
        </code>
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section id="Headings" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Headings</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>Headings are what you use to divide and give hierarchy to the content on your page. They are organized as below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          H1 - one per page
        </li>
        <li>
          H2 - one per page
        </li>
        <li>
          H3 - can be several on the same page
        </li>
        <li>
          H4 - can be several on the same page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are also H5, H6 etc, but you should seldom need to use more then H1-H4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google checks the H1 and H2 on your page to determine what the page is about. Therefore it is a very good idea to include your keyword or a variation of your keyword in both. This is also the reason that you should only have one H1 and one H2 per page. If you have several different ones it is much harder for Google to determine what the subject of your page is, and you of course want google to associate your page with your targeted keyword.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important that you try to put your keyword as close to the beginning of your heading as possible, as Google will give more weight to the words in the beginning compared to the end.
      </p>

  <section id="image_optimization" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Image optimization</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        There are several things you need to think about when you are going to add an image to your web page. Before you add it, make sure the file size is not unnecessarily large, as it might slow down your site speed. You also need to give the image a relevant file name, that preferably contains your target keyword.      </p>
     <p>
       You also need to give your image an Alt Text. The Alt Text should be a short and consist explanation of the image’s content, this provides an explanation for users who are visually impaired and who use page readers.   
     </p>
     <p>
       The Alt Text also holds value for SEO. Google cannot see what is shown in the picture, so they use the Alt Text to get that information. Thus, the Alt Text should contain your keyword as well, as it will give relevance to your page.
     </p>
     <h4>Implementation</h4>
     <p>
       To add an image and Alt Text to your page, you insert this in your HTLM code:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          <xmp>
 <img src="URL linking to your picture" 
 alt="Your Alt Text">
          </xmp>
        </code>
      </p>

  </section>
  <section id="internal_links" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Internal links</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>An internal link is when you link from one of your pages on your website, to another page on the same website. </p>
      <h4>
        Why do you want to link internally? 
      </h4>
      <p>
        Primarily because it helps Google to find all of your pages in a fast and easy way. If you have a page that is not linked to anywhere on your site, Google might never find it when they crawl your website. It is considered good practice to link to other pages on your website at least 2-3 times on each page, depending on the length of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you link to another page on your website, you are also transferring some of the <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority">authority</a> from that page, onto the page you are linking to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing to know about internal linking is that the page you are linking to can give relevance to the page you are linking from. Let’s say that you have a website where you sell bananas. You might have one page about what a banana is, and another page about why you have the best bananas. If this two pages link to each other it might help the search engine to understand the context of the two pages better.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you add an internal link you also need to add an Anchor Text. The Anchor text is the words that will show as the link in the content. Two paragraphs above this, we have linked to https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-authority with the Anchor Text “authority”. The Anchor Text should give a some indication to Google about the subject of the page you are linking to.
      </p>
      <h4>Implementation</h4>
      <p>
        To add an internal (or outbound) link with an Anchor text you need to add the following to your HTML code:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          <xmp>
 <a href="www.your-domain.com/other-page">
 Your Anchor Text</a>
          </xmp>
        </code>
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section id="outbound_links" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Outbound links</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Outbound links works in much the same way as internal. But here you are linking to another website, not another page on the same domain. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives google a hint to what other websites are related to your topic, and again gives relevancy to your page. So, in the example above with the website about bananas, you would probably want to link to another website that handles the topic of bananas, fruits, quality of fruit or similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t overdo the linking, 2-3 outbound links per page, same as internal links, are enough. You implement an outbound link the same way as shown above in the section for internal links.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section id="content" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Content</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        What should your content look like for optimal chance of ranking in Google? To start with, make sure that you have something meaningful to say, or at least that the content you put on your page make sense there. Google understands when you put “gibberish content” on your page just to have some content, and that will affect you negatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The length of the content is also important. Many SEO experts say that long articles with high word count is crucial. That can be true, but as mentioned above, never fill out the content with unnecessary nonsense to make it longer. On the other hand, if you have a page with very short or almost no content, that can be harmful as Google will take it as a sign of bad quality. If you have a lot of pages like that, you should start sorting that out as soon as possible as it might even result in your site getting a <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-identifying-and-recovering-from-a-google-penalty/">Google penalty</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always make sure that your content is unique. You do not want duplicate content on several of your pages. This is also a sign of a website with bad quality.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section id="optimized_url" class="main-section">
    <header><h3>Optimized URL</h3></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        When someone sees the URL for your page, in a best case scenario that should be enough for them to understand what your website is about. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid long, complicated and ugly URLs, like this: <br><b>www.your-domain.com/35434/filter/document/article-title</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimize the URL to be short and include your keyword: <br><b>www.your-domain.com/your-keyword</b>.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
   <section id="multimedia" class="main-section">
    <header><h2>Multimedia</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Try to add engaging pictures and videos on your page. This have the potential to catch the users interest and make them stay longer on your page. It can also reduce the bounce rate (bounce rate = the percentage of visits that result in no further browsing of your website, the user leaves when they have only seen the first landing page).
      <p>
      <p>
        Both the dwell time on the page and the bounce rate are important user interaction ranking factors.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Implementation
      </h4>
      <p>
        We explained how to add an image to your page under the section “image optimization”. When adding a video you usually want to embed it from Youtube or a similar website.
      </p>
      <p>
        To embed a video from Youtube is very easy. Just go to the video that you want to embed, under it you can click on “Share” -> “Embed” , and you will get a prepared iframe element looking something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code id="multimedia-code">
          <xmp>
  <iframe width="560" height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Am35"
  frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
  autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; 
  picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
          </xmp>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can then edit it yourself. Maybe you want to change the size by editing the width and height, or remove “autoplay” if you don’t want the video to start automatically. You then add the iframe element to your HTML code.
      </p>
    </article>

 <section id="responsive_design" class="main-section">
    <header><h2>Responsive design</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>
        If you think about it, how many times a day do you quickly google something on your phone, compared to how many times you use a computer to google something? Since smartphones has taken over the world, mobile search has exploded. Therefore, Google are now focusing primarily on mobile search instead of searches via a computer. And that makes it easy to understand how extremely important it is that your website has a responsive design. A responsive design adjusts to the size of the device that the website is being visited from. So, the website will look equally amazing, and be equally user friendly via desktop and mobile.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Implementation
      </h4>
      <p>
        A responsive web design is primarily created by using CSS and @media queries. Basically you will create different versions of your CSS file for devices of different devices. With the @media query, you will inform the browser to change the design of the website if the device matches a particular site. It can look something like the below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code id="responsive-code">
          <xmp>
      #header {
        height: 100px;
        width: 100vw;
      }

      @media (max-width: 520px) {
  
      #header {
        height: 80px;
        width: 100vw;
      }
      }
          </xmp>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, the original header (adapted for desktop) have a height of 100px and a width of 100% of the device view width. Below that there is a @media query that specifies that on all devices that has a width of 520px or less (most smartphones), the height of the header will be 80px instead. The width is still 100vw, which will be adapted so that it is 100% of the phones width instead.
